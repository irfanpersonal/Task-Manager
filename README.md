# Task-Manager

Task Manager is an awesome app that lets you easily create, view, and update tasks. I revamped the whole thing using TypeScript for both the backend and frontend. Plus, I took the time to add some documentation, making it super useful for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A powerful and flexible superset of JavaScript, bringing static typing to your projects.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A scalable and flexible NoSQL database, perfect for handling diverse data types.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, making server-side development a breeze.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, ideal for server-side scripting.
- [React](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
